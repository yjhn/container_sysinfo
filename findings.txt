Containers share with the host:
- uptime (same value as on host)

Containers get their own:
- process space (i.e. host processes not visible)
- disks

Disks seem to inherit the disk space of the host, but the files inside the container's filesystem are from the container image.
Process space is separate for each container, i.e. they don't see host's processes and PIDs start from 1 inside the container.
